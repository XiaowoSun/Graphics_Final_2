# Data

Raw Data:

We are using the Restaurant Inspection Data provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) from NYC Open Data for this project(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j). Since this is a daily updated dataset, we are using the version which was updated by April 18, 2019.

The original dataset is too large to upload to Github.

Cleaned Data:

The cleaned datasets are still too large to upload to Github. They can be generated by our data preprocessing files.
